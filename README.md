# URL Shortener Web

This repository contains the web client application for [URL Shortener API](https://github.com/laporeon/url-shortener-api). It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the API and manage shortened URLs.

The only required environment variable is `VITE_API_URL`, the URL of the backend API service.

Make sure to set this variable in your `.env` file or deployment environment to point the web client to the correct API endpoint.
